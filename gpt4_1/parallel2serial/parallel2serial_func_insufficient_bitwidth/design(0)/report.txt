Sure, here is the corrected Verilog code for the parallel2serial module. The problem was that the register 'data' was defined as a 3-bit register, but you were trying to access the 4th bit. I changed the register 'data' to be a 4-bit register.

```verilog
`timescale 1ns/1ns
module parallel2serial(
	input wire clk  ,
	input wire rst_n  ,
	input wire [3:0]d ,
	output wire valid_out ,
	output wire dout
	);


reg [3:0] data = 'd0; //change this line
reg [1:0]cnt;
reg valid;
assign dout = data[3];
assign valid_out =valid;
always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
    if(!rst_n)begin
        data<= 'd0;
        cnt <= 'd0;
        valid <= 'd0;
    end
    else  begin
                
		if (cnt == 'd3) begin
			data <= d;
			cnt <= 'd0;
			valid <= 1;
		end
		else begin
			cnt <= cnt + 'd1;
			valid <= 0;
			data  <= {data[2:0],data[3]}; //change this line
		end
    end
		
end


endmodule
```
I have updated the 'data' register to be a 4-bit register and also updated the bit shifting operation. Now, the 'data' register is shifted to the right, and the most significant bit of 'data' is assigned to the least significant bit of the new 'data' value.
