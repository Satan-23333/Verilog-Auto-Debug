Here is the corrected design code:

```verilog
module	parallel2serial(
	input wire clk,
	input wire rst_n,
	input wire [3:0] d, // Changed from d_in to d to match module definition
	output wire valid_out,
	output wire dout
	);

reg [3:0] data = 'd0;
reg [1:0]cnt;
reg valid;

assign dout = data[3];
assign valid_out = valid;

always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
    if(!rst_n)begin
        data<= 'd0;
        cnt <= 'd0;
        valid <= 'd0;
    end
    else  begin
                
		if (cnt == 'd3) begin
			data <= d; // Changed from d_in to d to match input declaration
			cnt <= 'd0;
			valid <= 1;
		end
		else begin
			cnt <= cnt + 'd1;
			valid <= 0;
			data  <= {data[2:0],data[3]};
		end
    end
end
endmodule
```

The problem in the initial design was that the input port was declared as 'd' in the module definition but was being used as 'd_in' in the implementation. So, I just had to replace 'd_in' with 'd' in the implementation to make it consistent with the module definition.
