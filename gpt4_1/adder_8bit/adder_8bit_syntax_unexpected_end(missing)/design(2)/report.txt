The error in your code seems to be related to the use of "reg" in the declaration of the output variables. In Verilog, you cannot assign values to "reg" type variables using continuous assignments. 

This is your corrected code:

```verilog
module	adder_8bit(
    input [7:0] a, b,
    input cin,
    output [7:0] sum,
    output cout);
    
    wire [7:0] c;

    full_adder FA0 (.a(a[0]), .b(b[0]), .cin(cin), .sum(sum[0]), .cout(c[0]));
    full_adder FA1 (.a(a[1]), .b(b[1]), .cin(c[0]), .sum(sum[1]), .cout(c[1]));
    full_adder FA2 (.a(a[2]), .b(b[2]), .cin(c[1]), .sum(sum[2]), .cout(c[2]));
    full_adder FA3 (.a(a[3]), .b(b[3]), .cin(c[2]), .sum(sum[3]), .cout(c[3]));
    full_adder FA4 (.a(a[4]), .b(b[4]), .cin(c[3]), .sum(sum[4]), .cout(c[4]));
    full_adder FA5 (.a(a[5]), .b(b[5]), .cin(c[4]), .sum(sum[5]), .cout(c[5]));
    full_adder FA6 (.a(a[6]), .b(b[6]), .cin(c[5]), .sum(sum[6]), .cout(c[6]));
    full_adder FA7 (.a(a[7]), .b(b[7]), .cin(c[6]), .sum(sum[7]), .cout(c[7]));

    assign cout = c[7]; 
endmodule

module	full_adder (input a, b, cin, output sum, cout);
    assign {cout, sum} = a + b + cin;
endmodule
```

In the above correction, "output reg" was changed to "output" for the sum and cout outputs in the adder_8bit module. The "reg" data type is for variables that hold their value until explicitly changed, as in procedural blocks. The "wire" data type is for variables that represent connections and that get their values from the output of a gate or module, as in continuous assignments. This is why "reg" was not suitable in your original code.
