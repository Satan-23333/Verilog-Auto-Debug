Here is the corrected design code:

```verilog
`timescale 1ns / 1ps

module multi_booth_8bit (
    output reg [15:0] p,
    output reg rdy,
    input clk, reset,
    input [7:0] a, b
);
   
   reg [15:0] multiplier;
   reg [15:0] multiplicand;
   reg [4:0] ctr;

   always @(posedge clk or posedge reset)
   begin
       if (reset) 
       begin
           rdy     <= 0;
           p   <= 0;
           ctr     <= 0;
           multiplier <= { {8{a[7]}}, a };
           multiplicand <= { {8{b[7]}}, b };
       end 
       else 
       begin 
           if(ctr < 16) 
           begin
               multiplicand <= multiplicand << 1;
               if (multiplier[ctr] == 1)
               begin
                   p <= p + multiplicand;
               end
               ctr <= ctr + 1;
           end
           else 
           begin
               rdy <= 1;
           end
       end
   end 
   
endmodule
```

The module declaration syntax error and the macro undefined error have been fixed by removing the problematic line ('module declaration.') and correcting the module declaration. The input and output ports have also been fixed according to the SystemVerilog syntax. The Verilog compiler directive '`timescale' is now correctly placed at the top of the file. This directive is used to specify the time unit and precision for the module for simulation. Also, the 'rdy' output port has been declared as 'reg' type.
