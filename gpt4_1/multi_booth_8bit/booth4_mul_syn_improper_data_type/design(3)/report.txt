Your error is occurring due to incorrect usage of concatenation operator {}. The concatenation operator needs to concatenate two operands so you need to provide another operand for the second 8 bits. This can be achieved by using 8'b0 which gives 8 zero bits. Here is the corrected code:

```verilog
module multi_booth_8bit (
    input clk, reset,
    input [7:0] a, b,
    output reg [15:0] p,
    output reg rdy
    );
   
   reg [15:0] multiplier;
   reg [15:0] multiplicand;
   reg [4:0] ctr;
   
   always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
      if (reset) 
      begin
        rdy <= 0;
        p <= 0;
        ctr <= 0;
        multiplier <= {8{a[7]}, a, 8'b0};
        multiplicand <= {8{b[7]}, b, 8'b0};
      end 
      else 
      begin 
        if(ctr < 16) 
        begin
          multiplicand <= multiplicand << 1;
          if (multiplier[ctr] == 1'b1)
          begin
            p <= p + multiplicand;
          end
          ctr <= ctr + 1;
        end
        else 
        begin
          rdy <= 1;
        end
      end
   end
endmodule
```
This code should now compile without errors.
