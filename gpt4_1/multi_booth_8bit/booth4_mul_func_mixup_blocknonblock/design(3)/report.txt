Sure, your design has a minor error in the line where you are initializing the multiplier and multiplicand. You are trying to sign extend these variables, but you're not extending the sign bit correctly. Here is the corrected Verilog code:

```verilog
module multi_booth_8bit (
    input wire clk,
    input wire reset,
    input wire [7:0] a,
    input wire [7:0] b,
    output reg [15:0] p,
    output reg rdy
);
    reg [15:0] multiplier;
    reg [15:0] multiplicand;
    reg [4:0] ctr;

    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) begin
            rdy <= 0;
            p <= 0;
            ctr <= 0;
            multiplier <= {{8{a[7]}}, a};
            multiplicand <= {{8{b[7]}}, b};
        end 
        else begin 
            if(ctr < 16) begin
                p = p + (multiplier[0] ? multiplicand : 16'h0);
                multiplier = {multiplier[15:1], multiplier[15]};
                multiplicand = multiplicand << 1;
                ctr = ctr + 1;
            end
            else begin
                rdy <= 1;
            end
        end
    end
endmodule
```

The only change is in the multiplier and multiplicand initialization lines inside the reset condition. The correct way to sign extend an 8-bit value to a 16-bit value in Verilog is to use the replication operator "{ {8{a[7]}}, a }" which repeats the most significant bit of 'a' 8 times and then concatenates it with 'a'. Similarly, for 'b', use "{ {8{b[7]}}, b }".
