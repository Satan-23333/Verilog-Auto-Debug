Sure, the error seems to come from the way you are attempting to perform sign extension. The error is pointing to the lines where you have written `multiplier <= {8{a[7]}, a};` and `multiplicand <= {8{b[7]}, b};`.

The correct way to perform sign extension in Verilog is as follows: `multiplier <= {{8{a[7]}}, a};` and `multiplicand <= {{8{b[7]}}, b};`.

Here is the corrected code:

```verilog
module multi_booth_8bit (p, rdy, clk, reset, a, b);
    input clk, reset;
    input [7:0] a, b;
    output reg [15:0] p;
    output reg rdy;
   
    reg [15:0] multiplier;
    reg [15:0] multiplicand;
    reg [4:0] ctr;

always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
    if (reset) 
    begin
        rdy     <= 0;
        p       <= 16'b0;
        ctr     <= 5'b0;
        multiplier <= {{8{a[7]}}, a}; // sign extension for multiplier
        multiplicand <= {{8{b[7]}}, b}; // sign extension for multiplicand
    end 
    else 
    begin 
        if(ctr < 16) 
        begin
           multiplicand <= multiplicand << 1;
           if (multiplier[ctr] == 1'b1)
           begin
               p <= p + multiplicand;
           end
           ctr <= ctr + 1'b1;
        end
        else 
        begin
            rdy <= 1'b1;
        end
    end
end //End of always block
    
endmodule
```
This corrected code should now compile without any errors.
