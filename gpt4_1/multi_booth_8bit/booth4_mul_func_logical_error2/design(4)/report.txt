The error in your code is at the line where you are trying to sign extend the 8-bit inputs a and b to 16-bit. The correct syntax to do this in verilog is {8{a[7]}},a and {8{b[7]}},b. Here is the corrected code:

```verilog
module multi_booth_8bit (p, rdy, clk, reset, a, b);
   input clk, reset;
   input [7:0] a, b;
   output reg [15:0] p;
   output reg rdy;
   
   reg [15:0] multiplier;
   reg [15:0] multiplicand;
   reg [4:0] ctr;

always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
    if (reset) 
    begin
      rdy     <= 0;
      p       <= 0;
      ctr     <= 0;
      multiplier <= {8{a[7]},a};
      multiplicand <= {8{b[7]},b};
    end 
    else 
    begin 
      if(ctr < 16) 
      begin
        multiplicand <= multiplicand << 1;
        if (multiplier[ctr] == 1)
        begin
          p <= p + multiplicand;
        end
        ctr <= ctr + 1;
      end
      else 
      begin
        rdy <= 1;
      end
    end
  end //End of always block
    
endmodule
```

This code should now compile without any syntax error.
