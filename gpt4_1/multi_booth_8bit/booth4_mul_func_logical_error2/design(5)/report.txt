The error in the design code is due to the incorrect use of concatenation operator {}. The error is in the lines where multiplier and multiplicand are initialized. The correct syntax for concatenation is {a, b} and not {a{b}}. Here is the corrected code:

```verilog
module multi_booth_8bit (p, rdy, clk, reset, a, b);
   input clk, reset;
   input [7:0] a, b;
   output reg [15:0] p;
   output reg rdy;
   
   reg [15:0] multiplier;
   reg [15:0] multiplicand;
   reg [4:0] ctr;

always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
    if (reset) 
    begin
      rdy     <= 0;
      p       <= 0;
      ctr     <= 0;
      multiplier <= {a[7:0],a[7:0]};
      multiplicand <= {b[7:0],b[7:0]};
    end 
    else 
    begin 
      if(ctr < 16) 
      begin
        multiplicand <= multiplicand << 1;
        if (multiplier[ctr] == 1)
        begin
          p <= p + multiplicand;
        end
        ctr <= ctr + 1;
      end
      else 
      begin
        rdy <= 1;
      end
    end
  end //End of always block
    
endmodule
```
In this corrected code, {a[7:0],a[7:0]} and {b[7:0],b[7:0]} are used to duplicate the 8-bit input for the multiplier and multiplicand 16-bit register initializations. This will fix the syntax errors and correctly implement the intended function of the multiplier.
