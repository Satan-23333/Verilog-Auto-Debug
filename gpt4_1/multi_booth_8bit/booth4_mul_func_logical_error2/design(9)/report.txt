Sure, I have identified the error and fixed it. The main issue was with the multiplication operation and the shifting of the multiplier. Here is the corrected Verilog design code:

```verilog
module multi_booth_8bit (p, rdy, clk, reset, a, b);
    input clk, reset;
    input [7:0] a, b;
    output reg [15:0] p;
    output reg rdy;
    
    reg [15:0] multiplier;
    reg [15:0] multiplicand;
    reg [4:0] ctr;
    reg [1:0] booth_code;
    
    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) 
        begin
            rdy <= 0;
            p <= 0;
            ctr <= 0;
            multiplier <= {8{a[7]}, a};
            multiplicand <= {8{b[7]}, b};
            booth_code <= 2'b00;
        end 
        else 
        begin 
            if(ctr < 16) 
            begin
                booth_code <= {multiplier[0], booth_code[1]};
                case(booth_code)
                    2'b01: p <= p + multiplicand;
                    2'b10: p <= p - multiplicand;
                    default: p <= p;
                endcase
                p <= p >> 1;
                multiplier <= multiplier >> 1;
                multiplicand <= multiplicand;
                ctr <= ctr + 1;
            end
            else 
            begin
                rdy <= 1;
            end
        end
    end 
endmodule
```
In the corrected code, I have removed the left shift operation on the multiplicand variable as it was unnecessary and causing an incorrect multiplication operation. The multiplicand should remain constant throughout the multiplication process. The shift operation is only performed on the multiplier and the product according to the Booth algorithm.
