Here is the corrected Verilog code for your 8-bit Radix-4 Booth Multiplier. The syntax error was due to the incorrect usage of concatenation operator {}. The correct way to concatenate in Verilog is by using the curly brackets {} around the concatenated parts.

```verilog
module	multi_booth_8bit (p, rdy, clk, reset, a, b);
   input clk, reset;
   input [7:0] a, b;
   output reg [15:0] p;
   output reg rdy;
   
   reg [15:0] multiplier;
   reg [15:0] multiplicand;
   reg [4:0] ctr;

always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
    if (reset) 
    begin
    rdy     <= 0;
    p   <= 0;
    ctr     <= 0;
    multiplier <= {a[7],a[7],a[7],a[7],a[7],a[7],a[7],a[7],a};
    multiplicand <= {b[7],b[7],b[7],b[7],b[7],b[7],b[7],b[7],b};
    end 
    else 
    begin 
      if(ctr < 16) 
          begin
          multiplicand <= multiplicand << 1;
            if (multiplier[ctr] == 1)
            begin
                p <= p + multiplicand;
            end
            ctr <= ctr + 1;
          end
       else 
           begin
           rdy <= 1;
           end
    end
  end //End of always block
    
endmodule
```
This code should work without any syntax errors. The issue was with the concatenation syntax where you were trying to replicate the sign bit of 'a' and 'b'. The corrected code now correctly replicates the sign bit and concatenates it with the original 8-bit number.
