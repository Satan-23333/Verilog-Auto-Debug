Sure. Here is the corrected design code:

```verilog
`timescale 1ns / 1ps

module multi_booth_8bit (p, rdy, clk, reset, a, b);
   input clk, reset;
   input [7:0] a, b;
   output reg [15:0] p;
   output reg rdy;
   
   reg [15:0] multiplier;
   reg [15:0] multiplicand;
   reg [4:0] ctr;

   always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
      if (reset) 
      begin
         rdy     <= 0;
         p   <= 0;
         ctr     <= 0;
         multiplier <= {{8{a[7]}}, a};
         multiplicand <= {{8{b[7]}}, b};
      end 
      else 
      begin 
         if(ctr < 16) 
         begin
            multiplicand <= multiplicand << 1;
            if (multiplier[ctr] == 1'b1)
            begin
               p <= p + multiplicand;
            end
            ctr <= ctr + 1;
         end
         else 
         begin
             rdy <= 1;
         end
      end
   end //End of always block

endmodule
```

The error in your design code was that you were trying to access `a[8]` and `b[8]` which are out of bounds. In Verilog, array indices start from 0, so an 8-bit signal has indices ranging from 0 to 7. To fix the error, I replaced `a[8]` and `b[8]` with `a[7]` and `b[7]` respectively.
