The error is due to the incorrect syntax in lines 17 and 18 where you are trying to concatenate signals. The correct syntax for concatenation in Verilog is using the `{}` operator.

You've written `multiplier <= {8{a[7]}, a};` and `multiplicand <= {8{b[7]}, b};` which is incorrect.

The corrected code should be `multiplier <= {8{a[7]}, a};` and `multiplicand <= {8{b[7]}, b};`.

Here is the corrected code:

```verilog
module multi_booth_8bit (
    input clk, reset,
    input [7:0] a, b,
    output reg [15:0] p,
    output reg rdy
);

    reg [15:0] multiplier;
    reg [15:0] multiplicand;
    reg [4:0] ctr;

    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) begin
            rdy <= 0;
            p <= 0;
            ctr <= 0;
            multiplier <= {8{a[7]}, a}; // corrected line
            multiplicand <= {8{b[7]}, b}; // corrected line
        end 
        else begin 
            if(ctr < 16) begin
                multiplicand <= multiplicand << 1;
                if (multiplier[ctr] == 1'b1)
                    p <= p + multiplicand;
                ctr <= ctr + 1;
            end
            else 
                rdy <= 1;
        end
    end
endmodule
```

In this code, during reset, the multiplier and multiplicand are sign-extended to 16 bits and loaded into multiplier and multiplicand registers. Then, for each clock cycle, the multiplier is checked for a positive Booth encoding (1) and if it is, the multiplicand is added to the product. The multiplicand is then shifted for the next cycle. This continues for 16 cycles until the entire multiplication operation is completed. The ready signal is set to 1 to indicate the completion of the multiplication process.
