Sure, here is the corrected version of multi_booth_8bit design code:

```verilog
module multi_booth_8bit (
    input clk, reset,
    input [7:0] a, b,
    output reg [15:0] p,
    output reg rdy
);

    reg [15:0] multiplier;
    reg [15:0] multiplicand;
    reg [4:0] ctr;

    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) begin
            rdy <= 0;
            p <= 0;
            ctr <= 0;
            multiplier <= {8{a[7]}, a}; // corrected line
            multiplicand <= {8{b[7]}, b}; // corrected line
        end 
        else begin 
            if(ctr < 16) begin
                multiplicand <= multiplicand << 1;
                if (multiplier[ctr] == 1'b1)
                    p <= p + multiplicand;
                ctr <= ctr + 1;
            end
            else 
                rdy <= 1;
        end
    end
endmodule
```

In the original code, the multiplier and multiplicand were incorrectly initialized. The correct implementation should sign-extend the 8-bit inputs to 16 bits by repeating the sign bit 8 times for correct operation in all cases. This is achieved by using `{8{a[7]}, a}` and `{8{b[7]}, b}`. Furthermore, the bit comparison `multiplier[ctr] == 1'b1` was added for clarity.
