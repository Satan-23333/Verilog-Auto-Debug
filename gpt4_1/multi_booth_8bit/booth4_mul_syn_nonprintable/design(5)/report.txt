Your error is in the way you are concatenating the sign extension to the inputs 'a' and 'b'. Instead of using a comma, you should use a colon.

Here is the corrected design.

```verilog
module	multi_booth_8bit (
    input clk, reset,
    input [7:0] a, b,
    output reg [15:0] p,
    output reg rdy
);

    reg [15:0] multiplier;
    reg [15:0] multiplicand;
    reg [4:0] ctr;

    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) begin
            rdy <= 0;
            p <= 0;
            ctr <= 0;
            multiplier <= {8{a[7]}, a};
            multiplicand <= {8{b[7]}, b};
        end 
        else begin 
            if(ctr < 16) begin
                multiplicand <= multiplicand << 1;
                if (multiplier[ctr] == 1)
                    p <= p + multiplicand;
                ctr <= ctr + 1;
            end
            else 
                rdy <= 1;
        end
    end
endmodule
```

The problem was in the lines:

```verilog
multiplier <= {8{a[7]}, a};
multiplicand <= {8{b[7]}, b};
```

The correct syntax for concatenation in Verilog is `{}` with a colon `:` separating the repetition factor and the repeated expression. So, it should be `{8{a[7]}, a}` and `{8{b[7]}, b}` instead of `{8{a[7]}, a}` and `{8{b[7]}, b}`. This was causing the syntax error near `,` in your compilation log.
