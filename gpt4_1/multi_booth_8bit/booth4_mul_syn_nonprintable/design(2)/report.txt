Here is the corrected Verilog code for the 8-bit Radix-4 booth multiplier:

```verilog
module	multi_booth_8bit (
    input clk, reset,
    input [7:0] a, b,
    output reg [15:0] p,
    output reg rdy
);

    reg [15:0] multiplier;
    reg [15:0] multiplicand;
    reg [4:0] ctr;

    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) begin
            rdy <= 0;
            p <= 0;
            ctr <= 0;
            multiplier <= {a[7], a[7], a[7], a[7], a[7], a[7], a[7], a[7], a};
            multiplicand <= {b[7], b[7], b[7], b[7], b[7], b[7], b[7], b[7], b};
        end 
        else begin 
            if(ctr < 16) begin
                multiplicand <= multiplicand << 1;
                if (multiplier[ctr] == 1)
                    p <= p + multiplicand;
                ctr <= ctr + 1;
            end
            else 
                rdy <= 1;
        end
    end
endmodule
```

The error in the original code was due to incorrect usage of the replication operator {}. The correct syntax to replicate a bit 8 times is {8{bit}}. However, this syntax does not allow concatenation with another value (like 'a' or 'b' in your case) directly. Therefore, I have manually replicated 'a[7]' and 'b[7]' eight times in the corrected code.
