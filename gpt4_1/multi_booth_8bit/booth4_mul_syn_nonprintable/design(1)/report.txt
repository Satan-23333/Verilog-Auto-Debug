Sure, the error messages in the compile report are about the syntax used in defining the multiplier and multiplicand registers. The concatenation operator '{}' expects inputs to be separated by a colon, not a comma. This should be corrected.

Here is the corrected code:

```verilog
module multi_booth_8bit (
    input clk, reset,
    input [7:0] a, b,
    output reg [15:0] p,
    output reg rdy
);

    reg [15:0] multiplier;
    reg [15:0] multiplicand;
    reg [4:0] ctr;

    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) begin
            rdy <= 0;
            p <= 0;
            ctr <= 0;
            multiplier <= {8{a[7]}, a};
            multiplicand <= {8{b[7]}, b};
        end 
        else begin 
            if(ctr < 16) begin
                multiplicand <= multiplicand << 1;
                if (multiplier[ctr] == 1)
                    p <= p + multiplicand;
                ctr <= ctr + 1;
            end
            else 
                rdy <= 1;
        end
    end
endmodule
```

In the corrected code, the multiplier and multiplicand registers are defined as sign-extended 16-bit versions of the inputs a and b, respectively. This is done using the concatenation operator '{}', with the 8th bit of the respective inputs being replicated 8 times to form the most significant 8 bits of the 16-bit registers.
