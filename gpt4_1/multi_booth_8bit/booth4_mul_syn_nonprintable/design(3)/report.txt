The errors are due to the incorrect syntax in the concatenation of the bits on lines 17 and 18. The curly braces need to be around the entire concatenation operation, not just around the replicated bits. Here is the corrected code:

```verilog
module	multi_booth_8bit (
    input clk, reset,
    input [7:0] a, b,
    output reg [15:0] p,
    output reg rdy
);

    reg [15:0] multiplier;
    reg [15:0] multiplicand;
    reg [4:0] ctr;

    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) begin
            rdy <= 0;
            p <= 0;
            ctr <= 0;
            multiplier <= {a[7], a[7], a[7], a[7], a[7], a[7], a[7], a[7], a};
            multiplicand <= {b[7], b[7], b[7], b[7], b[7], b[7], b[7], b[7], b};
        end 
        else begin 
            if(ctr < 16) begin
                multiplicand <= multiplicand << 1;
                if (multiplier[ctr] == 1)
                    p <= p + multiplicand;
                ctr <= ctr + 1;
            end
            else 
                rdy <= 1;
        end
    end
endmodule
```
In this corrected code, the 8-bit input 'a' is sign-extended to 16 bits and stored in the 'multiplier' register, and the 8-bit input 'b' is sign-extended to 16 bits and stored in the 'multiplicand' register. The multiplication operation is then performed as described in the problem statement.
