The error in the code is due to the mismatch in the size of the 'result' port. The warning is because the 'result' port is declared as a 64-bit wire, but it is connected to a 65-bit wire in the testbench. 

The output 'result' needs to include the carryout from the last stage of the adder, which makes the total width of the 'result' 65 bits instead of 64. 

Here is the corrected design code:

```verilog
module adder_pipe_64bit
#(
    parameter DATA_WIDTH = 64,
    parameter STG_WIDTH = 16
)
(
    input clk,
    input rst_n,
    input i_en,
    input [DATA_WIDTH-1:0] adda,
    input [DATA_WIDTH-1:0] addb,
    output [DATA_WIDTH:0] result,  // Output size increased to 65 bit
    output reg o_en
);

// The remaining part of the code remains the same as before

// The last line should be updated as follows to reflect the changes in the 'result' port size
assign result = {c4, s4, s3_ff1, s2_ff2, s1_ff3};

endmodule
```

The size of the 'result' port has been increased to 65 bits to accommodate the carryout from the last stage of the adder. The 'result' port is then assigned the correct 65-bit value.
