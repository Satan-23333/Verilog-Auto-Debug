Here's the corrected design code for the 16-bit divider module:

```verilog
module div_16bit(
    input wire [15:0] A,
    input wire [7:0] B,
    output wire [15:0] result,
    output wire [15:0] odd
);

reg [15:0] a_reg;
reg [15:0] b_reg;
reg [31:0] tmp_a;
reg [15:0] quotient;
reg [15:0] remainder;
integer i;

always @(*) begin
    a_reg = A;
    b_reg = B;
    tmp_a = {16'b0, a_reg};
    quotient = 16'b0;
    remainder = 16'b0;
    for(i = 15; i >= 0; i = i-1) begin
        remainder = remainder << 1;
        remainder[0] = tmp_a[i];
        if (remainder >= b_reg) begin
            remainder = remainder - b_reg;
            quotient[i] = 1'b1;
        end
    end
end

assign odd = remainder;
assign result = quotient;

endmodule
```

This code performs a long division operation starting from the most significant bit of the dividend `A`. The remainder is updated by left-shifting the previous remainder and concatenating the current bit of the dividend. Then, it checks if the updated remainder is larger than or equal to the divisor `B`. If so, it subtracts the divisor from the remainder and sets the corresponding bit of the quotient to 1. This process is repeated for all bits of the dividend. The final values of the remainder and the quotient are assigned to the outputs `odd` and `result`, respectively.
