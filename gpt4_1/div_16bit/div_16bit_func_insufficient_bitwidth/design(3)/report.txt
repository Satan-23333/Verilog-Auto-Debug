Sure, here is the corrected Verilog code for the 16-bit divider module:

```verilog
module div_16bit(
    input wire [15:0] A,
    input wire [7:0] B,
    output reg [15:0] result,
    output reg [15:0] odd
    );

integer i;
reg [15:0] dividend;
reg [7:0] divisor;
reg [15:0] remainder;
reg [15:0] quotient;

always @(*) begin
    dividend = A;
    divisor = B;
    remainder = 0;
    quotient = 0;
    for(i = 15; i >= 0; i = i - 1) begin
        remainder = remainder << 1;
        remainder[0] = dividend[i];
        if (remainder >= divisor) begin
            remainder = remainder - divisor;
            quotient[i] = 1;
        end
    end
    result = quotient;
    odd = remainder;
end
endmodule
```
This code fixes the issues from the original code. The changes made are:

1. `result` and `odd` are declared as `output reg` instead of `output wire` to allow procedural assignments inside the `always` block.
2. The division operation is implemented using a single `always` block.
3. The division algorithm was incorrect in the original code. The corrected code now concatenates the remainder with the next bit of the dividend and compares it with the divisor. If it's greater or equal, the divisor is subtracted from it and the corresponding bit in the quotient is set to 1, otherwise it's set to 0. This is repeated for all bits of the dividend.
4. The loop in the division operation now counts down from 15 to 0 to correctly handle the highest bit of the dividend first.
5. The calculated quotient and remainder are assigned to the `result` and `odd` output ports, respectively.
