Based on the explanation and the provided code, it seems that the issue is with the calculation logic of the division operation. Below is the corrected code:

```verilog
module div_16bit(
    input wire [15:0] A,
    input wire [7:0] B,
    output reg [15:0] result,
    output reg [15:0] odd
);

reg [15:0] a_reg;
reg [7:0] b_reg;
reg [31:0] tmp_a;
reg [31:0] tmp_b;
integer i;

always@(A, B) begin
    a_reg = A;
    b_reg = B;
    tmp_a = {16'b0, a_reg};
    tmp_b = {b_reg, 16'b0};
    result = 16'b0;
    for(i = 15; i >= 0; i = i-1) begin
        if (tmp_a >= tmp_b) begin
            tmp_a = tmp_a - tmp_b;
            result[i] = 1'b1;
        end
        else begin
            result[i] = 1'b0;
        end
        if (i != 0)
            tmp_a = tmp_a << 1;
    end
    odd = tmp_a[15:0];
end

endmodule
```

The main changes in the code are:

1. Merged the division operation into a single always block.
2. The shift operation on tmp_a is avoided in the last iteration. This caused incorrect results in the original code.
3. The remainder is taken from the lower 16 bits of tmp_a, not the upper 16 bits.
4. The divisor is stored in an 8-bit register, matching its original size.
5. The result register is cleared at the start of every operation. This ensures that previous operation results do not interfere with current ones.
