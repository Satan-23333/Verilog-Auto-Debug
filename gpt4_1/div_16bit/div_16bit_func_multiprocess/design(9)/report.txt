Sure, based on the description and the error, it seems that the 'odd' value is not updated properly in the loop. Here is the corrected code:

```verilog
module div_16bit(
    input wire [15:0] A,
    input wire [7:0] B,
    output reg [15:0] result,
    output reg [15:0] odd
);
    reg [31:0] tmp_a;
    reg [15:0] tmp_b;
    integer i;

    always @(*) begin
        tmp_a = {16'b0, A};
        tmp_b = {8'b0, B};
        result = 16'b0;
        odd = 16'b0;

        for(i = 15; i >= 0; i = i-1) begin
            if (tmp_a[31:16] >= tmp_b) begin
                tmp_a[31:16] = tmp_a[31:16] - tmp_b;
                result = result << 1;
                result[0] = 1;
            end
            else begin
                result = result << 1;
            end
            tmp_a = {tmp_a[30:0], A[i]};
        end
        odd = tmp_a[15:0];
    end
endmodule
```

The main change here is the line inside the loop where 'tmp_a' is updated. Instead of using 'odd[15]' as the least significant bit of 'tmp_a', the corresponding bit from the input 'A' is used. This is because 'odd' is not updated throughout the loop, and using 'A[i]' ensures that all bits of 'A' are processed as described in the problem statement.
