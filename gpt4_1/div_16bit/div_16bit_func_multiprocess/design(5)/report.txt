Certainly, it appears that there were some mistakes in the original divider module. Here is the corrected Verilog code for the 16-bit divider module. The key correction here is that tmp_b, which is the divisor, should not be left shifted in each iteration. Instead, tmp_a, the dividend, should be left shifted.

```verilog
module div_16bit(
    input wire [15:0] A,
    input wire [7:0] B,
    output reg [15:0] result,
    output reg [15:0] odd
);

reg [31:0] tmp_a;
reg [31:0] tmp_b;
integer i;

always @(*) begin
    tmp_a = {16'b0, A};
    tmp_b = {24'b0, B};
    result = 16'b0;
    for(i = 15; i >= 0; i = i-1) begin
        tmp_a = tmp_a << 1;
        if (tmp_a[31:16] >= tmp_b[7:0]) begin
            tmp_a[31:16] = tmp_a[31:16] - tmp_b[7:0];
            result = result << 1;
            result[0] = 1;
        end
        else begin
            result = result << 1;
        end
    end
    odd = tmp_a[15:0];
end

endmodule
```

This version of the design shifts the dividend left in each iteration and compares the high bits of the dividend with the divisor. If the dividend is larger, it subtracts the divisor and sets the lowest bit of the result to 1. Otherwise, it just shifts the result left. The remainder is taken from the low bits of the dividend after all iterations. This version should work correctly according to the original specification.
