Sure, I have modified the design code. The Verilog code you provided has a fundamental error in the way the division operation is implemented. Here is the corrected code:

```verilog
module div_16bit(
    input wire [15:0] A,
    input wire [7:0] B,
    output reg [15:0] result,
    output reg [15:0] odd
);

reg [31:0] tmp_a;
reg [31:0] tmp_b;
integer i;

always @(*) begin
    tmp_a = {16'b0, A};
    tmp_b = {24'b0, B};
    result = 16'b0;
    odd = 16'b0;
    for(i = 15; i >= 0; i = i-1) begin
        if (tmp_a[31:16] >= tmp_b[7:0]) begin
            tmp_a[31:16] = tmp_a[31:16] - tmp_b[7:0];
            result = result << 1;
            result[0] = 1;
        end
        else begin
            result = result << 1;
        end
        tmp_a = {tmp_a[30:0], odd[15]};
    end
    odd = tmp_a[15:0];
end

endmodule
```

In the original code, the remainder was not updated correctly. The remainder should be updated by concatenating the difference (tmp_a[31:16] - tmp_b[7:0]) with the highest remaining bit of the dividend. This is achieved by the line `tmp_a = {tmp_a[30:0], odd[15]};` in the corrected code.
