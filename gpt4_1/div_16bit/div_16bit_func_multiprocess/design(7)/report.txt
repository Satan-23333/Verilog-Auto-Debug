Sure, based on the problem statement, the division operation in the code seems to be incorrect. The error is in the logic of how the remainder is calculated and concatenated with the remaining bits of the dividend. The corrected code is provided below:

```verilog
module div_16bit(
    input wire [15:0] A,
    input wire [7:0] B,
    output reg [15:0] result,
    output reg [15:0] odd
);

reg [31:0] tmp_a;
reg [15:0] tmp_b;
integer i;

always @(*) begin
    tmp_a = {16'b0, A};
    tmp_b = B;
    result = 16'b0;
    odd = 16'b0;

    for(i = 15; i >= 0; i = i-1) begin
        if (tmp_a[31:16] >= tmp_b) begin
            tmp_a[31:16] = tmp_a[31:16] - tmp_b;
            result = result << 1;
            result[0] = 1;
        end
        else begin
            result = result << 1;
        end
        tmp_a = {tmp_a[31:16], tmp_a[15:1], odd[15]};
    end
    odd = tmp_a[15:0];
end

endmodule
```

In this code, the dividend's higher bits are compared with the divisor. If they are larger, the difference is calculated and the quotient bit is set to 1. If not, the quotient bit is set to 0. Then, the remainder (difference) is concatenated with the next highest bit of the dividend, and the process is repeated. Please test this modified code and let me know if it works as expected.
