Here is the corrected Verilog code for your 16-bit divider module.

```verilog
module	div_16bit(
    input wire [15:0] A,
    input wire [7:0] B,
    output reg [15:0] result,  // declare as output reg
    output reg [15:0] odd
    );

reg [15:0] a_reg;
reg [15:0] b_reg;
reg [31:0] tmp_a;
reg [31:0] tmp_b;
integer i;

always@(*) begin
    a_reg = A;
    b_reg = B;
    tmp_a = {16'b0, a_reg};
    tmp_b = {b_reg, 16'b0};
    result = 0;
    odd = 0;
    for(i = 15; i >= 0; i = i-1) begin
        tmp_a = tmp_a << 1;
        if (tmp_a[31:16] >= tmp_b[15:0]) begin
            tmp_a[31:16] = tmp_a[31:16] - tmp_b;
            result[i] = 1'b1;
        end
        else begin
            result[i] = 1'b0;
        end
    end
    odd = tmp_a[31:16];
end

endmodule
```
The error in the original code was related to the shifting and comparison operations. Initially, `tmp_a` is shifted after the comparison, which results in the loss of the most significant bit of the dividend. In the corrected code, `tmp_a` is shifted before the comparison. This ensures that the most significant bit of `tmp_a` is always the bit that needs to be divided in the current iteration.

Additionally, the comparison and subtraction of `tmp_a` and `tmp_b` were initially done on the entire 32 bits. But `tmp_b` only has valid data in its lower 16 bits. Therefore, in the corrected code, the comparison and subtraction are done only on the upper 16 bits of `tmp_a` and the lower 16 bits of `tmp_b`.

Finally, `result` and `odd` are initialized to 0 at the beginning of the always block. Without this, they could retain old values which could lead to incorrect results.
