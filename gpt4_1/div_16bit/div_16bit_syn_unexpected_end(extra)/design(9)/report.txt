Below is the corrected version of the divider module. The issue was with the shift operation, which was not performed correctly for the dividend. Also, the calculation of the remainder was incorrect due to the wrong register usage.

```verilog
module div_16bit (
    input wire [15:0] A,
    input wire [7:0] B,
    output reg [15:0] result,
    output reg [15:0] odd
    );
    
    reg [16:0] a_reg; 
    reg [8:0] b_reg; 
    integer i;

    always @(*)
    begin
        a_reg = {1'b0, A}; 
        b_reg = {1'b0, B}; 
        result = 16'b0;
        odd = 16'b0;

        for(i = 0; i < 16; i = i+1) begin
            if (a_reg[16:9] >= b_reg) begin
                a_reg[16:9] = a_reg[16:9] - b_reg;
                result = (result << 1) | 1'b1; 
            end
            else begin
                result = result << 1;
            end
            a_reg = {a_reg[15:0],1'b0}; // Shift operation for the dividend
        end
        odd = a_reg[15:0]; // Correct register for remainder calculation
    end
endmodule
```

The above code first compares the higher bits of the dividend with the divisor. If the dividend bits are greater or equal, it subtracts the divisor from those bits, shifts the result to the left, and sets the least significant bit to 1. If the dividend bits are less, it just performs the shift operation. The shift operation for the dividend is performed at the end of each iteration, and the remainder is calculated correctly now.
