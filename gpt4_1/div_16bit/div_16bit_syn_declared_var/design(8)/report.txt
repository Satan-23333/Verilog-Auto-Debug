Sure, based on the description and the error report, it seems the issue is with the calculation of the result and remainder. Here is the corrected Verilog code:

```verilog
module div_16bit(
    input [15:0] A,
    input [7:0] B,
    output reg [15:0] result,
    output reg [15:0] odd
);
    reg [15:0] a_reg;
    reg [7:0] b_reg;
    integer i;

    always @(*) begin
        a_reg = A;
        b_reg = B;
        result = 16'b0;
        odd = a_reg;

        for(i=15; i>=0; i=i-1) begin
            if ((odd>>8) >= b_reg) begin
                odd = {odd[15:8] - b_reg, odd[7:0]};
                result = (result << 1) | 1'b1;
            end else
                result = result << 1;
            
            if(i > 0)
                odd = {odd[14:0], a_reg[i-1]};
        end
    end
endmodule
```

In this updated code, the key adjustment is in how the `odd` variable is being updated during the comparison with `b_reg`. Since the `odd` variable is intended to be the remainder and is being compared with `b_reg` to decide whether to subtract the divisor from it or not, we need to be sure that we're comparing the correct bits of `odd` with `b_reg`. Therefore, we use the `>>8` operation to shift the 16-bit `odd` variable 8 bits to the right, effectively comparing the higher 8 bits of `odd` with `b_reg`. 

Also, when updating `odd` after the subtraction, we concatenate the result of the subtraction with the lower 8 bits of `odd`, ensuring that `odd` is properly updated for the next iteration of the division operation.
