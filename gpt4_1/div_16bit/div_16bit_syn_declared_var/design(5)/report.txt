Here is the corrected Verilog code. In the previous code, the division process was not being executed correctly. The code has been modified to first shift the value of the dividend 'A' into the 'odd' register and then perform the division operation, shifting the quotient into the 'result' register.

```verilog
module div_16bit(
    input [15:0] A,
    input [7:0] B,
    output reg [15:0] result,
    output reg [15:0] odd
);
    reg [15:0] a_reg;
    reg [7:0] b_reg;
    integer i;

    always @(*) begin
        a_reg = A;
        b_reg = B;
        result = 16'b0;
        odd = a_reg;

        for(i=15; i>=0; i=i-1) begin
            if (odd[15:8] >= b_reg) begin
                odd[15:8] = odd[15:8] - b_reg;
                result = (result << 1) | 1'b1;
            end else
                result = result << 1;
            
            if(i > 0)
                odd = {odd[14:0], a_reg[i-1]};
        end
    end
endmodule
```

In this code, we start by shifting the dividend into the 'odd' register. Then, for each bit in the dividend (starting from the most significant bit), we check if the upper 8 bits of the 'odd' register are greater than or equal to the divisor. If this is true, we subtract the divisor from these 8 bits and shift a '1' into the 'result' register. If not, we simply shift a '0' into the 'result' register. After each iteration, we shift the next bit of the dividend into the 'odd' register, effectively performing a division operation.
