Here is the corrected design code:

```verilog
module	adder_32bit(A,B,S,C32);
    input [31:0] A;
    input [31:0] B;
    output [31:0] S;
    output C32;

    wire c16,gx1,px1,gx2,px2;

    CLA_16 CLA1(
        .A(A[15:0]),
        .B(B[15:0]),
        .c0(1'b0),
        .S(S[15:0]),
        .px(px1),
        .gx(gx1)
    );

    CLA_16 CLA2(
        .A(A[31:16]),
        .B(B[31:16]),
        .c0(c16),
        .S(S[31:16]),
        .px(px2),
        .gx(gx2)
    );

    assign c16 = gx1 | (px1 & 1'b1); 
    assign C32 = gx2 | (px2 & c16);
endmodule

module	CLA_16(A,B,c0,S,px,gx);
    input [15:0] A;
    input [15:0] B;
    input c0;
    output [15:0] S;
    output wire gx,px;

    wire c4,c8,c12;
    wire Gm1,Pm1,Gm2,Pm2,Gm3,Pm3,Gm4,Pm4;

    adder_4 adder1(
        .x(A[3:0]),
        .y(B[3:0]),
        .c0(c0),
        .c4(c4),
        .F(S[3:0]),
        .Gm(Gm1),
        .Pm(Pm1)
    );

    // ...

    assign c4 = Gm1 | (Pm1 & c0),
           c8 = Gm2 | (Pm2 & c4) | (Pm2 & Pm1 & c0),
           c12 = Gm3 | (Pm3 & c8) | (Pm3 & Pm2 & c4) | (Pm3 & Pm2 & Pm1 & c0);

    assign px = Pm1 & Pm2 & Pm3 & Pm4,
           gx = Gm4 | (Pm4 & Gm3) | (Pm4 & Pm3 & Gm2) | (Pm4 & Pm3 & Pm2 & Gm1);
endmodule

module	adder_4(X,Y,Cin,F,Gm,Pm);

    input [3:0] X,Y;
    input Cin;
    output [3:0] F;
    output Gm, Pm;

    assign F = X ^ Y ^ Cin;
    assign Gm = (X & Y) | (Cin & (X ^ Y));
    assign Pm = X | Y;
endmodule
```

The errors were in the `adder` module, where `F` and `Cout` were declared as `output reg`, which is illegal in continuous assignments. The `adder` module was also designed for single-bit inputs, so it was renamed to `adder_4` and modified to handle 4-bit inputs and outputs. In addition, the carry-lookahead logic for generating carry and propagate signals (`Gm` and `Pm`) was added. These signals are used to calculate the carry-out for each 4-bit block in the `CLA_16` module.
