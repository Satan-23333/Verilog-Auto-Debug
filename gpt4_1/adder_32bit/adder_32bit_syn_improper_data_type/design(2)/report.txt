The errors in your simulation report are indicating that the 'CLA_16' module is not defined. This means that the definition of the 'CLA_16' module is either missing, or it is not correctly linked in your project. I assume that you have defined the 'CLA_16' module correctly somewhere else, so I will provide the corrected code of the adder_32bit module for you:

```verilog
module adder_32bit(A,B,S,C32);
    input [31:0] A;
    input [31:0] B;
    output [31:0] S;
    output C32;

    wire px1,gx1,px2,gx2;
    wire c16;

    CLA_16 CLA1(
        .A(A[15:0]),
        .B(B[15:0]),
        .c0(1'b0),
        .S(S[15:0]),
        .px(px1),
        .gx(gx1)
    );

    CLA_16 CLA2(
        .A(A[31:16]),
        .B(B[31:16]),
        .c0(c16),
        .S(S[31:16]),
        .px(px2),
        .gx(gx2)
    );

    assign c16 = gx1 | (px1 & 1'b0); //c0 = 0
    assign C32 = gx2 | (px2 & c16);
endmodule
```

However, without seeing your 'CLA_16' module, I cannot ensure the correctness of the above code. Please make sure your 'CLA_16' module is correctly defined and linked to your top module. If you continue to encounter errors, please provide your 'CLA_16' module for further assistance.
