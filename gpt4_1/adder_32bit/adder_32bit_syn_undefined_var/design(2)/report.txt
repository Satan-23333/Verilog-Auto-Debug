Based on the error messages in your simulation report, it seems that the issue is that the module 'CLA_16' is not defined. This module is being called in your 'adder_32bit' module, but it is not present in your code. To fix this, we need to add the definition of the 'CLA_16' module to your code. Unfortunately, I cannot provide the exact code for the 'CLA_16' module as the implementation details are not provided. 

However, a potential 'CLA_16' module might look like follows:

```verilog
module CLA_16 (A, B, c0, S, px, gx);
  input [15:0] A;
  input [15:0] B;
  input c0;
  output [15:0] S;
  output px, gx;

  // Implement your carry-lookahead adder logic here
endmodule
```

Now, your 'adder_32bit' module should be able to find the 'CLA_16' module:

```verilog
module adder_32bit(A,B,S,C32);
  input [31:0] A;
  input [31:0] B;
  output [31:0] S;
  output C32;

  wire px1,gx1,px2,gx2;
  wire c16;

  CLA_16 CLA1(
    .A(A[15:0]),
    .B(B[15:0]),
    .c0(0),
    .S(S[15:0]),
    .px(px1),
    .gx(gx1)
  );

  CLA_16 CLA2(
    .A(A[31:16]),
    .B(B[31:16]),
    .c0(c16),
    .S(S[31:16]),
    .px(px2),
    .gx(gx2)
  );

  assign c16 = gx1 ^ (px1 && 0); //c0 = 0
  assign C32 = gx2 ^ (px2 && c16);
endmodule
```

Please note that you need to replace the comment in the 'CLA_16' module with the actual implementation of a 16-bit carry-lookahead adder. The code above just gives the basic structure of the 'CLA_16' module and doesn't include the specific logic for a carry-lookahead adder.
