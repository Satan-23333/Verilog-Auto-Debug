Sure. The error in your code is related to the signal 'c0' being declared as a single bit but being connected to a 32-bit signal. Here is a corrected version of your code:

```verilog
module CLA_16 (input [15:0] A, B, input c0, output [15:0] S, output px, gx);
  // Implement your carry-lookahead adder logic here
endmodule

module adder_32bit(input [31:0] A, B, output [31:0] S, output C32);
  wire px1,gx1,px2,gx2;
  wire c16;

  CLA_16 CLA1(
    .A(A[15:0]),
    .B(B[15:0]),
    .c0(1'b0),
    .S(S[15:0]),
    .px(px1),
    .gx(gx1)
  );

  CLA_16 CLA2(
    .A(A[31:16]),
    .B(B[31:16]),
    .c0(c16),
    .S(S[31:16]),
    .px(px2),
    .gx(gx2)
  );

  assign c16 = gx1 ^ (px1 && 1'b0); //c0 = 0
  assign C32 = gx2 ^ (px2 && c16);
endmodule
```
In the corrected version, I have changed the size of 'c0' to a single bit with value '0'. You will need to update your CLA_16 module to correctly handle this input signal.
