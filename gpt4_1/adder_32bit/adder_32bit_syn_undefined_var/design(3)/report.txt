Your design code should look like this:

```verilog
module CLA_16 (input [15:0] A, B, input c0, output [15:0] S, output px, gx);
  // Implement your carry-lookahead adder logic here
endmodule

module adder_32bit(input [31:0] A, B, output [31:0] S, output C32);
  wire px1,gx1,px2,gx2;
  wire c16;

  CLA_16 CLA1(
    .A(A[15:0]),
    .B(B[15:0]),
    .c0(0),
    .S(S[15:0]),
    .px(px1),
    .gx(gx1)
  );

  CLA_16 CLA2(
    .A(A[31:16]),
    .B(B[31:16]),
    .c0(c16),
    .S(S[31:16]),
    .px(px2),
    .gx(gx2)
  );

  assign c16 = gx1 ^ (px1 && 0); //c0 = 0
  assign C32 = gx2 ^ (px2 && c16);
endmodule
```

Please note that the logic for the 16-bit Carry Lookahead Adder (CLA_16 module) is not provided in the question, so you need to implement it by yourself. The CLA_16 module takes two 16-bit inputs A and B, a carry-in c0, and produces a 16-bit sum output S, a propagate output px, and a generate output gx.

Your 32-bit adder (adder_32bit module) consists of two instances of the 16-bit CLA (CLA_16 module). The first 16 bits of inputs A and B are added by the first instance of CLA_16, and the remaining 16 bits are added by the second instance of CLA_16. The carry-out of the first instance is used as the carry-in for the second instance. The final carry-out is generated by using the propagate and generate outputs of the second instance of CLA_16.
