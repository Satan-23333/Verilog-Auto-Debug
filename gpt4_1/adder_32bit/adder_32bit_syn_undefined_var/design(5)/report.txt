Here is the corrected design code:

```verilog
module	CLA_16 (input [15:0] A, B, input c0, output [15:0] S, output c16);
  wire [15:0] g, p, c;
  genvar i;
  generate
  for (i=0; i<16; i=i+1) begin : generate_g_p_c
    assign g[i] = A[i] & B[i];
    assign p[i] = A[i] ^ B[i];
    if (i==0)
      assign c[i] = g[i] | (p[i] & c0);
    else
      assign c[i] = g[i] | (p[i] & c[i-1]);
  end
  endgenerate
  assign S = p ^ c;
  assign c16 = c[15];
endmodule

module	adder_32bit(input [31:0] A, B, output [31:0] S, output C32);
  wire c16;

  CLA_16 CLA1(
    .A(A[15:0]),
    .B(B[15:0]),
    .c0(1'b0),
    .S(S[15:0]),
    .c16(c16)
  );

  CLA_16 CLA2(
    .A(A[31:16]),
    .B(B[31:16]),
    .c0(c16),
    .S(S[31:16]),
    .c16(C32)
  );
endmodule
```

The logic for the 16-bit carry-lookahead adder (CLA_16) was modified to correctly compute the carry and propagate values. The carry-lookahead logic was implemented using a generate loop. The loop calculates the generate, propagate, and carry values for each bit. 

The top-level module (adder_32bit) was modified to correctly pass the carry-out from the lower 16-bit adder (CLA1) to the higher 16-bit adder (CLA2). 

This should resolve the error reported in the testbench. Please recompile and rerun the testbench to verify the corrected design.
