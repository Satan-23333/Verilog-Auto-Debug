Here is the corrected Verilog code:

```verilog
module CLA_16 (input [15:0] A, B, input c0, output [15:0] S, output px, gx);
    // The logic for 16-bit CLA goes here
endmodule

module adder_32bit (input [31:0] A, B, output [31:0] S, output C32);
    wire [1:0] p, g, c;
    wire [15:0] S0, S1;

    CLA_16 U1 (.A(A[15:0]), .B(B[15:0]), .c0(1'b0), .S(S0), .px(p[0]), .gx(g[0])); // lower 16 bits
    CLA_16 U2 (.A(A[31:16]), .B(B[31:16]), .c0(c[1]), .S(S1), .px(p[1]), .gx(g[1])); // upper 16 bits

    assign S = {S1, S0};
    assign c[0] = g[0] | (p[0] & 1'b0);
    assign c[1] = g[1] | (p[1] & c[0]);
    assign C32 = g[1] | (p[1] & c[1]);

endmodule
```
The error in the initial design was in the propagation and generation of carry. Carry from the first CLA_16 (U1) module is supposed to be used as carry-in for the second CLA_16 (U2) module. But in the initial design, the carry-in for U2 was wrongly assigned as `c[0]` which is not yet assigned at that point. So, I corrected it to `c[1]` which correctly holds the carry output from U1. Similarly, the carry calculation `assign c` and `assign C32` were corrected.
