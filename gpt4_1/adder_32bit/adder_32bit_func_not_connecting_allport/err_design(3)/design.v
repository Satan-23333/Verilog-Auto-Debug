module	'CLA_16' is not defined in your provided code. This module is necessary for the 'adder_32bit' module to function correctly. The 'CLA_16' module should be defined in the same file or included from another file.

Unfortunately, without the definition of the 'CLA_16' module, I cannot provide a complete solution. However, I can give you a hint on how the 'CLA_16' module might be defined. 

```verilog
module CLA_16(
    input [15:0] A,
    input [15:0] B,
    input c0,
    output [15:0] S,
    output px,
    output gx
);
    // Implement the logic for 16-bit carry lookahead adder
endmodule
