Sure, here is the corrected Verilog code:

```verilog
module CLA_16(
  input [15:0] A,
  input [15:0] B,
  input C_in,
  output [15:0] S,
  output C_out
);
  // Your implementation of carry-lookahead adder goes here.
  // This is just a dummy implementation, replace it with actual logic.
  assign S = A + B + C_in;
  assign C_out = (A[15] & B[15]) | (C_in & (A[15] | B[15]));
endmodule

module adder_32bit(
  input [31:0] A,
  input [31:0] B,
  output [31:0] S,
  output C32
);
  wire c16;

  CLA_16 CLA1(
    .A(A[15:0]),
    .B(B[15:0]),
    .C_in(1'b0),
    .S(S[15:0]),
    .C_out(c16)
  );

  CLA_16 CLA2(
    .A(A[31:16]),
    .B(B[31:16]),
    .C_in(c16),
    .S(S[31:16]),
    .C_out(C32)
  );
endmodule
```

Please note that the 'CLA_16' module here is just an example. It adds the inputs 'A' and 'B' with the carry-in 'C_in' to produce the sum 'S' and the carry-out 'C_out'. You should replace it with the actual logic of the 16-bit Carry Lookahead Adder. The 'adder_32bit' module is a 32-bit adder that uses two instances of the 'CLA_16' module. The carry-out of the first 16-bit adder is used as the carry-in of the second 16-bit adder. The final carry-out is the carry-out of the second 16-bit adder.
