Sure, here is the corrected Verilog code for a 32-bit adder using CLA architecture.

```verilog
module CLA_16 (
    input [15:0] A, B, 
    input c0, 
    output [15:0] S, 
    output px, gx, 
    output c16
);
   // CLA_16 implementation here.
endmodule

module adder_32bit(
    input [31:0] A,
    input [31:0] B,
    output [31:0] S,
    output C32
);

wire px1,gx1,px2,gx2;
wire c16;

CLA_16 CLA1(
    .A(A[15:0]),
    .B(B[15:0]),
    .c0(1'b0),
    .S(S[15:0]),
    .px(px1),
    .gx(gx1),
    .c16(c16)
);

CLA_16 CLA2(
    .A(A[31:16]),
    .B(B[31:16]),
    .c0(c16),
    .S(S[31:16]),
    .px(px2),
    .gx(gx2),
    .c16(C32)
);

assign c16 = gx1 ^ (px1 && 1'b0); //c0 = 0
assign C32 = gx2 ^ (px2 && c16);

endmodule
```

Please note that carry-lookahead logic for the 16-bit CLA_16 module needs to be implemented. The logic for generating propagate (px) and generate (gx) signals for each bit, as well as the logic for calculating the carry (c16), should be developed inside the CLA_16 module.

The adder_32bit module is already instantiating two CLA_16 modules to form a 32-bit adder using carry-lookahead logic. The first 16-bit CLA_16 adder (CLA1) takes the lower 16 bits of A and B as inputs and generates the lower 16 bits of the sum (S[15:0]). The second 16-bit CLA_16 adder (CLA2) takes the higher 16 bits of A and B as inputs and the carry-out from CLA1 (c16) as the input carry and generates the higher 16 bits of the sum (S[31:16]) and the final carry-out (C32).
