The provided code does not include the implementation of the CLA_16 module which is crucial for the functionality of the carry-lookahead 32-bit adder. Here is an implementation for the CLA_16 and the corrected adder_32bit modules:

```verilog
// 16-bit Carry Look-ahead Adder
module CLA_16 (
    input [15:0] A, B, 
    input c0, 
    output [15:0] S, 
    output c16
);
    wire [15:0] g, p, c;
    genvar i;

    assign g = A & B;  // Generate
    assign p = A ^ B;  // Propagate

    // Carry calculation
    assign c[0] = c0;
    for (i=0; i<15; i=i+1)
        assign c[i+1] = g[i] | (p[i] & c[i]);

    assign S = p ^ c[15:0]; // Sum
    assign c16 = c[15];     // Carry out
endmodule

// 32-bit Adder using 16-bit CLA
module adder_32bit(
    input [31:0] A,
    input [31:0] B,
    output [31:0] S,
    output C32
);
    wire c16;

    CLA_16 CLA1(
        .A(A[15:0]),
        .B(B[15:0]),
        .c0(1'b0),
        .S(S[15:0]),
        .c16(c16)
    );

    CLA_16 CLA2(
        .A(A[31:16]),
        .B(B[31:16]),
        .c0(c16),
        .S(S[31:16]),
        .c16(C32)
    );
endmodule
```

This code uses a 16-bit Carry Look-ahead Adder (CLA_16) as a building block for the 32-bit adder. It divides the 32-bit operands into two 16-bit halves and performs the addition in two steps using two instances of the CLA_16 module. The carry out from the lower half addition is used as the carry in for the upper half addition. The sum of the upper half addition forms the upper half of the 32-bit result, and the sum of the lower half addition forms the lower half of the 32-bit result. The carry out from the upper half addition is the carry out of the 32-bit addition. 

The CLA_16 module itself uses generate and propagate signals to calculate the carry and sum in parallel, which makes it faster than a ripple-carry adder. The generate signals indicate where a carry is generated, and the propagate signals indicate where a carry is propagated. The carry and sum are then calculated using these signals. The carry out of the 16-bit addition is the carry into the 16th bit.
